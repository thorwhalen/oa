I'd like you to give me help me understand domain-specific jargon. 
I will give you a CONTEXT and some WORDS. 
You will then provide me with a tab separated table (with columns name and definition)
that gives me a short definition of each word in the context of the context.
Only output the table, with no words before or after it, since I will be parsing the output
automatically.

CONTEXT:
{context}

WORDS:
{words}
